## Module 14 Challenge

This challenge is to demonstrate the ability to create an interactive dashboard from an imported json (using D3) regarding a Belly Button Biodiversity dataset.  

The requirements are as follows:

* Use D3 libray to read in the json from a URL
* Create a horizontal bar chart with a drop down menu to display to 10 OTU's (operational taxonomic units)
* Create a bubble chart that displays each sample  
* Display metatdata for the indvidual on the page  
* Update the plots when a new sample is selected with drop down  
* Deploy page to GitHub Pages    

## Process and Resources
### Timeline
08?? Created repository, cloned locally, added and commited starter files.

0814 Successfully used D3 to pull in the json.  Worked on pulling data but got stuck.  Got advice with an idea on how to proceed during office hours.

0815 Set up README format. Successfully pulled top 10 OTU's to be able to work with.
